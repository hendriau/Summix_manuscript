July 14, 2021

| **Name** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| RSID | rsID per variant |
| cM_Block | Tag identifier to group centimorgan blocks within chromosome |
| CHR | Chromosome |
| POS | Position |
| A1 | Reference Allele |
| A2 | Alternate Allele |
| ref_AF_eur_1000G | Allele frequencies for continental reference European population (1000 Genomes) |
| ref_AF_afr_1000G | Allele frequencies for continental reference African population (1000 Genomes) |
| ref_AF_sas_1000G | Allele frequencies for continental reference South Asian population (1000 Genomes) |
| ref_AF_eas_1000G | Allele frequencies for continental reference East Asian population (1000 Genomes) |
| ref_AF_iam_1000G | Allele frequencies for continental reference Indigenous American population |

The remaining allele frequency vectors are from the genome aggregation database (gnomAD), with various forms of stratification. For a full breakdown of the population tags and groupings present, we refer to the [gnomAD website descriptions here](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2018-10-gnomad-v2-1/)
